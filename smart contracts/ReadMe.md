# LumosDAO Smart Contract

This is a simple Rust smart contract for a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The contract allows users to create a DAO, create proposals, vote on proposals, and execute them.

## Features

- **Create DAO:** Users can create a new DAO with a given name and token address.
- **Create Proposal:** DAO members can create proposals, each with a title and description.
- **Vote on Proposals:** Members can vote in favor or against proposals.
- **Execute Proposals:** Proposals can be executed if they receive enough votes.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Soroban SDK](https://github.com/soroban/soroban)

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

2. Build and deploy the smart contract using the Soroban SDK.

```bash
# Compile the contract
soroban-sdk build

# Deploy the contract
soroban-sdk deploy
```

3. Interact with the contract using the provided tests or your custom client.

### Tests

We have included test cases to ensure the functionality of the contract. Run the tests with the following command:

```bash
soroban-sdk test
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the smart contract:

```rust
// Create a DAO
test.contract.create(
    &test.token_admin,
    &test.token.address,
    &"DAO".into_val(&test.env),
);

// Create a proposal
let id: u32 = test.contract.create_proposal(
    &test.token_admin,
    &test.token.address,
    &"My First Proposal".into_val(&test.env), 
    &"Let's begin!".into_val(&test.env),
);

// Vote on a proposal
test.contract.vote_on_proposal(
    &id,
    &test.deposit_address,
);

// Execute a proposal
test.contract.execute_proposal(
    &id,
    &test.token_admin,
);
```
